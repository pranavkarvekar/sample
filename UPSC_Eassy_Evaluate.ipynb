    "essay=\"\"\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that traditionally required human cognitive abilities. AI has permeated almost every aspect of modern life, influencing how we work, communicate, and solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary role of AI is to enhance efficiency and decision-making. In industries such as healthcare, AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data to detect diseases early, predict outcomes, and recommend personalized treatment plans. In the business world, AI helps in automating repetitive tasks, managing inventory, and improving customer experiences through chatbots and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Education is another field where AI has made a significant impact. Intelligent tutoring systems can adapt to the learning pace of individual students, providing personalized guidance and feedback. AI also aids researchers by processing large datasets, identifying patterns, and generating insights that would take humans years to discover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, AI plays a vital role in improving safety and convenience in daily life. Self-driving cars, for example, use AI to interpret sensor data, predict traffic conditions, and make split-second driving decisions. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa make everyday tasks, from setting reminders to controlling smart home devices, more accessible and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the role of AI is not without challenges. Ethical concerns, such as privacy, bias, and job displacement, require careful consideration. The misuse of AI for surveillance, deepfakes, or autonomous weapons could pose serious societal risks. Therefore, alongside innovation, responsible development and regulation of AI are essential.\"\"\""

       "3. **Indian context** – Incorporating specific Indian initiatives (e.g., NITI Aayog’s AI strategy, Digital India projects, AI in Aadhaar, or AI‑enabled agricultural advisory services) would make the essay more relevant to the UPSC exam.\n",
       "4. **Conclusion** – The ending could be stronger with a concise, forward‑looking statement that ties together the opportunities and responsibilities, possibly suggesting a way forward for India.\n",
